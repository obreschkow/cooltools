Title: Practical Tools for Scientific Computations and Visualizations

Description: Collection of routines for efficient scientific computations in physics and astrophysics. These routines include utility functions, numerical computation tools, as well as visualisation tools. They can be used, for example, for generating random numbers from spherical and custom distributions, information and entropy analysis, special Fourier transforms, two-point correlation estimation (e.g. as in Landy & Szalay (1993) <doi:10.1086/172900>), binning & gridding of point sets, 2D interpolation, Monte Carlo integration, vector arithmetic and coordinate transformations. Also included is a non-exhaustive list of important constants and cosmological conversion functions. The graphics routines can be used to produce and export publication-ready scientific plots and movies, e.g. as used in Obreschkow et al. (2020, MNRAS Vol 493, Issue 3, Pages 4551â€“4569). These routines include special color scales, projection functions, and bitmap handling routines.
